## CREATING DATA FRAMES 

First create vectors for the data frame

```{r}
myFamilyNames <- c('Dad', 'Mom','Sis','Bro','Dog')
myFamilyAges <- c(43,42,12,8,5)
myFamilyGenders <- c('Male','Female','Female','Male','Female')
myFamilyWeights <- c(188,136,83,61,44)
```

Create the data frame from the above vectors

```{r}
myFamily <- data.frame(myFamilyNames,myFamilyAges,myFamilyGenders,myFamilyWeights)
myFamily
```
## EXPLORING DATA FRAMES

```{r}
str(myFamily)
```

```{r}
summary(myFamily)
```

```{r}
head(myFamily, 3)

tail(myFamily, 3)
```

## ACCESSING COLUMNS IN A DATA FRAME

Using an existing vector ... Adding a value

```{r}
myFamily$myFamilyAges

myFamilyAges <- c(myFamilyAges, 11)
myFamilyAges

myFamily$myFamilyAges #--- this causes an error

myFamily$myFamilyAges <- c(myFamily$myFamilyAges, 11)
```

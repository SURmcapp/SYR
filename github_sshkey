ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

this did not work in linux-- in Linux I needed to clone the repository from the command line
$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file to your clipboard
Tip: If pbcopy isn't working, you can locate the hidden .ssh folder, open the file in your favorite text editor, and copy it to your clipboard.
